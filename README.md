Now with git!

## Main

Program currently calculates the equation of state of either pure neutron matter or symmetric nuclear matter as described by the Thomas-Fermi
nuclear model

#### Potfunction

Expand to include checks for chemical equilibrium.

To Do:
 - [ ] Put potential equations into functions
 - [ ] Implement proton-neutron ratio scheme
 - [ ] Implement schemes for energy of electron from proton \(ensure electric neutrality)
 - [ ] Implement root-finding method for neutron Fermi energy
